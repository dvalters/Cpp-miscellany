# C-PythonWrapper

## A sample of how to get a simple Python wrapper set up for a very simple C++ program

These files contain a working example of writing a python wrapper around a C++ program or library. This approach uses Cython. I haven't found a good tutorial on the internet of how to do this, (most of them relate to C, which is *slightly* different -- C++ has a couple of gotchas that you need to watch out for. I'll add it to decvalts.github.io soon.
